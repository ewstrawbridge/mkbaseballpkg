Description: This package contains all the functions required to complete a STATISTIC 535 project covering (some of) my senior thesis work at Amherst College, using hidden Markov models to predict pitch patterns. This package uses sequences based on single at-bats for individual pitchers, with hidden states being pitches and observed states being balls-strikes counts.
